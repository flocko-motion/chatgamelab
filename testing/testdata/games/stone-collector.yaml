description: "A predictable test game for validating game engine behavior"
system_message_scenario: |
  A simple stone collection game for integration tests of the game engine. The game has very strict rules that you must follow exactly:
  
  RULES YOU MUST FOLLOW:
  1. Each turn, you MUST increment the "Day" status field by exactly 1
  2. When the player says they collect stones (e.g., "I collect 3 stones"), you MUST increment the "Stones" status field by that exact number
  3. The player starts at Day 1 with 0 stones
  4. Be consistent and predictable - no random events

system_message_game_start: |
  Day 1
  You have 0 stones.
  You stand in a field filled with stones. You can collect as many as you want each day.
